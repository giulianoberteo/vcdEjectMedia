# vcdEjectMedia
This PowerShell script will get the list of all vCD virtual machines and will try to eject any media attached from the vCD catalog.

At present the script does not work with ISO that are mounted outside of a vCD catalog, for instance a vmware-tools mounted iso.

As the branch name suggests, this version has been tested with vCloud Director for Service Provider 9.7 and api version 32.0
